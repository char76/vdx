Lazy Widgets v0.1
-----------------

This directory contains source code for the library liblwid.a.
It provides three widget classes:

1. XlButtonBox
   A widget that derives from XmManager. It's designed to create a
   box of XmPushButtons. The children are regular aligned horizontally
   or vertically.

2. XlCellTable
   As XlButtonBox this class derives from XmManager. The children are
   aligned in a row column grid. The constraint resources cellColumn and 
   cellRow determines the position in this table. The position of child
   within the table cell depends on the constraint resources 
   horizontalAlignment and verticalAlignment. These may have values like
   center, beginning, end and justify.

3. XlBubble
   This widget is derived from OverrideShell. The bubble is used to add
   ToolTips to your application. Currently the bubble is only a rectangle
   known from MS-Windows.
   The bubble creates automatically a XmLabel as child. The labelString of the 
   child is accessed by the resource labelString of XlBubble. To change 
   the background color you have to insert following line in the resource 
   file:
            *XlBubble*background: #FDFFCA
   To add such a ToolTip to another widget the XlBubble is created as
   a child of this widget. Enter and Leave events and timer are handled
   automatically.

The widget classes are designed to work with VDX. The most SetValues()
methods are NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED. Feel free to changed the source code
if you need it.
