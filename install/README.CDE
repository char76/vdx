The CDE version is build with XiGraphics CDE. To
run vdx on TriTeal CDE you have to rebuild libvdx.so.
Follow these steps:

Change to vdxlib source directory.

	cd src/vdxlib

Run the shell script config.sh.

	./config.sh

Answer yes, when the script asks you for CDE.
Otherwise type 'n' for NO.

If libvdx.so is built successfully, type 'make install'.
Now run the vdx.
